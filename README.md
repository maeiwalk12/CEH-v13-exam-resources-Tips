# ✅ CEH v13 – Study Guide & Exam Tips

Just cleared the **CEH v13 (Certified Ethical Hacker)** exam and wanted to share my preparation journey. This isn’t just about memorizing tools — it’s about understanding how attackers think and how to defend systems proactively.

CEH v13 comes with scenario-based questions that touch on **real-world hacking techniques, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures**. You'll need to understand the tools, techniques, and phases of ethical hacking — not just theory.

## 🗓️ Prep Timeline (~3.5 weeks)

- 📘 **Week 1:** Watched video content (EC-Council official course + YouTube) to understand the basics of network security, threat types, and hacking phases  
- 🧠 **Week 2:** Focused on hands-on practice using tools like Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, Burp Suite in a lab environment (TryHackMe, VirtualBox Kali VM, etc.)  
- 🧪 **Week 3+:** Practice exams from Skillcertpro, revisiting weak areas, Very close to main exam. 80% of the questions on real exam came from these sets. They also offered free instructor notes. Quite helpful for cramming imp topics before exam day.

## 🧭 Preparation Tips

- ✅ **Understand the Hacker Mindset** — Study all **five phases**: Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining Access, Maintaining Access, and Covering Tracks  
- ✅ **Practice with Real Tools** — Familiarize yourself with: `nmap`, `hydra`, `nikto`, `john`, `Metasploit`, `Wireshark`, `tcpdump`, `netstat`  
- ✅ **Skillcertpro Practice Tests** — 75–80% of the exam questions were **similar in concept and structure**  
- ✅ **Lab Practice is KEY** — Set up a local lab (Kali + vulnerable VMs like Metasploitable2 or DVWA)  
- ✅ **Use CEH v13 Blueprint** — EC-Council’s official exam objectives helped guide focus areas
